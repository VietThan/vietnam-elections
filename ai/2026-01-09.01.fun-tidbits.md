## Fun stats / tidbits (NA15-2021)

### Prompt

Find interesting todbits about the 2021 National Assembly election. Keep a growing list of
tidbits types as you scan constituencies one by one. Update this document as you find
new types of tidbits or once you've collected the interesting tidbits of a constituency.

### Plan
- Scan `staging.db` for notable attributes (occupations, religions, education, ages).
- Cross-check against results for vote totals and any annotations (e.g., ineligible).
- Collect 5–10 defensible tidbits with exact counts.

### Candidate ideas to validate
- Occupation outliers (e.g., religious roles like monk).
- Oldest/youngest candidates.
- Highest vote count / highest vote percentage.
- Locality or constituency with most candidates.
- Any unusual attribute strings (e.g., rare ethnicity/religion).

### Open questions
- How many tidbits do you want in the final write‑up? (Answer: as many as possible)
