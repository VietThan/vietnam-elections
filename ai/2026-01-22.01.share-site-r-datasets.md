# Post sharing the site on /r/datasets

## Draft 1

Hi guys,

I want to share [Vietnam Elections](https://bamboo-filing-cabinet.github.io/vietnam-elections/), a project I've been working on to make Vietnam election data more accessible, archived, and fully sourced.

The [code for both the site and the data is on GitHub](https://github.com/bamboo-filing-cabinet/vietnam-elections/), ensuring that any changes or corrections are fully open for future examination.

If anyone has been interested in this data before, I think you all would have been mystified by lack of English-based information, slow or buggy websites, and data soft-hidden behind PDFs.

I have only really mapped out the [2021 National Assembly XV election](https://bamboo-filing-cabinet.github.io/vietnam-elections/elections/na15-2021/) in anticipation of the coming [2026 Vietnamese legislative election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Vietnamese_legislative_election) but there are [already a wealth of interesting stats that can be found](https://bamboo-filing-cabinet.github.io/vietnam-elections/elections/na15-2021/quick-stats/), for example, did you know that in 2021:

1. ...the smallest gap between a winner and a loser in a constituency was only 197 votes, representing a 0.16% gap?
2. ...8 people born in 1990 or later won a seat, with 7 of them being women?
3. ...2 candidates only had middle school education?
4. ...1 person won, but was not confirmed?

I'm looking for contributors or anyone interested in building this project as I want to go and map out all the elections in Vietnam's history, primarily:

1. **Source hunters (no coding):** help find official/public source pages or PDFs (candidate lists, results tables, constituency/unit docs) — even just one link helps.
2. **Devs:** help automate collection + parsing (HTML/PDF → structured tables), validation, and reproducible builds.

For corrections or contribution, it would be best to start with either the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bamboo-filing-cabinet/vietnam-elections/issues) or use the [anonymous form](https://forms.gle/UaPUdJZ5SGrTKdr2A).

Now some is asking, "what is this Bamboo Filing Cabinet?" Well, it is the [umbrella GitHub organization](https://bamboo-filing-cabinet.github.io/) (org page [here](https://github.com/bamboo-filing-cabinet/)) that I've created to store and make accessible Vietnam-related datasets. I have some ideas of my own of future projects but if anyone has an idea for something that would fit under this umbrella, please feel free to reach out!

## Draft 2

Hi all,

TL;DR: Open, source-linked Vietnam election datasets (starting with NA15-2021) with reproducible pipelines + GitHub Pages site; seeking source hunters and devs.

I want to share [Vietnam Elections](https://bamboo-filing-cabinet.github.io/vietnam-elections/), a project I've been working on to make Vietnam election data more accessible, archived, and fully sourced.

The [code for both the site and the data is on GitHub](https://github.com/bamboo-filing-cabinet/vietnam-elections/). The pipeline is provenance-first: raw sources → scripts → JSON exports, and every factual field links back to a source URL with retrieval timestamps.
Data access: the exported datasets live in `public/data/` within the repo.

If anyone has been interested in this data before, I think you may have been stymied by the lack of English-language information, slow or buggy websites, and data soft-hidden behind PDFs.

So far I've mapped out the [2021 National Assembly XV election](https://bamboo-filing-cabinet.github.io/vietnam-elections/elections/na15-2021/) in anticipation of the coming [2026 Vietnamese legislative election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Vietnamese_legislative_election). There are already a bunch of interesting stats, for example, did you know that in 2021:

1. ...the smallest gap between a winner and a loser in a constituency was only 197 votes, representing a 0.16% gap?
2. ...8 people born in 1990 or later won a seat, with 7 of them being women?
3. ...2 candidates only had middle school education?
4. ...1 person won, but was not confirmed?

I'm looking for contributors or anyone interested in building this project as I want to map out all the elections in Vietnam's history, primarily:

1. **Source hunters (no coding):** help find official/public source pages or PDFs (candidate lists, results tables, constituency/unit docs) — even just one link helps.
2. **Devs:** help automate collection + parsing (HTML/PDF → structured tables), validation, and reproducible builds.

For corrections or contributions, it would be best to start with either the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bamboo-filing-cabinet/vietnam-elections/issues) or use the [anonymous form](https://forms.gle/UaPUdJZ5SGrTKdr2A).

You might ask, "what is this Bamboo Filing Cabinet?" It's the [umbrella GitHub organization](https://bamboo-filing-cabinet.github.io/) (org page [here](https://github.com/bamboo-filing-cabinet/)) I created to store and make accessible Vietnam-related datasets. It's community-run, not affiliated with any government agency, and focuses on provenance-first, reproducible, neutral datasets with transparent change history. If you have ideas for other Vietnam-related datasets, please reach out.
